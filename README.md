# AVL-Tree
# A program that implements the AVL Tree data structure supporting the following operations:
## 1. Search:
Search for a specific element in an AVL Tree.
## 2. Insertion:
Insert a new node in an AVL tree. Tree balance will be maintained via the rotation operations.
## 3. Deletions:
Delete a node from an AVL tree. Tree balance will be maintained via the
rotation operations.
## 4. Print Tree Height:
Print the height of the AVL tree. This is the longest path from the root to a leaf-node.

# Application: English Dictionary
As an application based on the AVL Tree implementation, the program implements a simple English dictionary, with a simple text-based user interface, supporting the following functionalities:
## 1. Load Dictionary:
through a file named “dictionary.txt”, containing alist of words. Each word will be in a separate line. The dictionary will be loaded into an AVL Tree.
## 2. Print Dictionary Size:
Prints the current size of your dictionary.
## 3. Insert Word:
Takes a word from the user and inserts it, only if it is not already in the dictionary. Otherwise, print an error message.
## 4. Look-up a Word:
Takes a word from the user and prints “YES” or “NO” according to whether it is found or not.
## 5. Remove Word:
Takes a word from the user and removes it from the dictionary. If the
word is not in the dictionary, print the appropriate error message.
## 6. Batch Look-ups:
provide the program with a text file, “queries.txt”, containing a list
of words to look up in the dictionary. The program will print the total number of found words. Also, for each word, it print the word and “YES” if it exists in the dictionary. Otherwise, print “NO”.
## 7. Batch Deletions:
Provide the program with a text file “deletions.txt” containing a list
of words to remove from the dictionary.
